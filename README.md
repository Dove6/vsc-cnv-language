# CNV Language - VS Code Extensions

The `cnv-language` extension deciphers CNV scripts from point-and-click games by Aidem Media on sight!

## Features

- Every opened CNV file is automatically deciphered. The process can be undone. If there is any problem with deciphering, you can always re-open the file to try again.
- Debug messages from the extension are written to an output channel named "CNV".

## Known Issues

- If a file gets deciphered shortly after VSCode starts up, it may not get marked as dirty.
